# Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a stock price prediction model using Linear Regression on historical data of Bank Nifty stock prices. 
The model is built using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. It predicts future stock prices based on past trends.

This project uses historical data from Bank Nifty to predict future stock prices using a simple Linear Regression model. 
The data is split into training and testing datasets, the model is trained, and predictions are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). 
The results are visualized with graphs for better understanding of the performance.
